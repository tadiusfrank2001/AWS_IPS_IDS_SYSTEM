# AWS GuardDuty Security Lab üõ°Ô∏è

A hands-on Terraform project that creates a realistic AWS security lab environment to demonstrate threat detection, incident response, and automated security remediation using AWS GuardDuty.

## üéØ Purpose

This project was created to deepen my understanding of AWS security services and practice building automated incident response systems. It simulates a real-world scenario where a compromised EC2 instance communicates with a known malicious IP address, triggering GuardDuty alerts and automated remediation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The lab creates a complete security monitoring and response pipeline:

- **Two EC2 instances**: One "compromised" victim and one "malicious" attacker
- **GuardDuty**: Monitors for suspicious network activity and threats
- **Custom Threat Intelligence**: S3-hosted threat list with the attacker's IP
- **Automated Response**: Lambda function that stops compromised instances
- **Alerting**: SNS notifications for security events
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Security Hub integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

1. **Clone and configure**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd guardduty-security-lab
   ```

2. **Create your variables file**:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```
   
   Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your values:
   ```hcl
   aws_access_key    = "your-access-key"
   aws_secret_key    = "your-secret-key"
   region           = "us-east-1"
   my_ip            = "YOUR.PUBLIC.IP.ADDRESS/32"
   public_key_path  = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
   alert_email      = "your-email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Deploy the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Confirm SNS subscription** in your email
