# AWS GuardDuty Security Lab üõ°Ô∏è

A hands-on Terraform project that creates a realistic AWS security lab environment to demonstrate threat detection, incident response, and automated security remediation using AWS GuardDuty.

## üéØ Purpose

This project was created to deepen my understanding of AWS security services and practice building automated incident response systems. It simulates a real-world scenario where a compromised EC2 instance communicates with a known malicious IP address, triggering GuardDuty alerts and automated remediation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The lab creates a complete security monitoring and response pipeline:

- **Two EC2 instances**: One "compromised" victim and one "malicious" attacker
- **GuardDuty**: Monitors for suspicious network activity and threats
- **Custom Threat Intelligence**: S3-hosted threat list with the attacker's IP
- **Automated Response**: Lambda function that stops compromised instances
- **Alerting**: SNS notifications for security events
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Security Hub integration
