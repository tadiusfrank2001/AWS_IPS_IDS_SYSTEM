# üõ°Ô∏è My AWS EC2 Compromise Detection Lab (Terraform Edition)

This is a personal project where I simulate an EC2 compromise scenario using AWS services, and automate the detection and remediation process using **Terraform**.

I built and destroyed a complete security automation pipeline entirely with code ‚Äî and it's Free Tier friendly as long as I clean everything up afterward.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

- Creates two EC2 instances:
  - `EC2-Compromised` (Amazon Linux 2)
  - `EC2-Malicious` (Amazon Linux 2023)
- Assigns a static Elastic IP to the malicious instance
- Hosts a threat list in S3 containing that Elastic IP
- Configures Amazon GuardDuty with the custom threat list
- Simulates malicious behavior from EC2-Compromised
- Triggers GuardDuty findings
- Sends alert notifications via SNS (optional)
- Automatically stops the compromised instance using Lambda triggered by EventBridge
