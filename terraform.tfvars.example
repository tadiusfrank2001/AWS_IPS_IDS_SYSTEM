# ===== SSH KEY SETUP =====
# Path to your SSH public key file
# 
# If you don't have an SSH key pair, create one:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/gd-lab-key
# 
# This creates two files:
# - ~/.ssh/gd-lab-key (private key - keep secure)
# - ~/.ssh/gd-lab-key.pub (public key - use path below)
#
public_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

# ===== NETWORK SECURITY =====
# Your public IP address in CIDR format for SSH access
# 
# Find your public IP: curl ifconfig.me
# Then format as CIDR: "YOUR_IP_HERE/32"
# 
# Example: if your IP is 203.0.113.45, use "203.0.113.45/32"
#
my_ip = "YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_HERE/32"
